# SRs_ML-based_workflows

A collection of cheminformatics and machine learning workflows for modeling Sigma-1 and Sigma-2 receptor (S1R, S2R) selectivity and activity using Mordred descriptors, molecular fingerprints, and multiple classifiers/regressors.

---

## Overview
This project provides data preprocessing, model training (nested CV + final models), and external validation scripts for classification, regression, and multiclass approaches applied to S1R/S2R ligands.

## Installation
Create a conda or virtualenv with Python â‰¥ 3.8 and install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may also need to install RDKit via conda:
```bash
conda install -c rdkit rdkit
```

---

## How to Run

### 1. Preprocessing
```bash
python scripts/data_preprocessing/SRs_data-cleaning.py
```

### 2. Model Training
- **Nested CV**: Run models in `scripts/nested_cv/[classification|regression|multiclass]/`
- **Final CV**: Scripts in `scripts/final_models/`

### 3. External Validation
```bash
python scripts/external_validation/classification.py --input data/external/... --output results/
```

---

## Models
Saved `.joblib` pipelines for:
- XGBoost, ExtraTrees, SVM, kNN classifiers
- ExtraTrees and XGBoost regressors
- ECFP-based selectivity models

> ðŸ§± If models exceed GitHubâ€™s size limit, download them via a shared link (see `download_instructions.md`).
